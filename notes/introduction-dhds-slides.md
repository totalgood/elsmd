# Digital Health Data Science

## What is Data Science?

- Doing science on data
- Testing hypotheses using data
- Making predictions using data
- Training predictive models using data
- Using machine learning to model the world

\note{

Data science is about applying the scientific method to data.
The scientific method is about testing hypotheses.
These hypothese are about new situations, new data that we haven't seen yet.
So Data Science allows us to make predictions about new data based on data that we have.
This isn't necessarily about predictions in the future.
Most of the time it means simply predicting one numerical fact, called the target, based on a bunch of other numerical facts, called features, predictors, or indicators.

# What's different?

- more data
- new algorithms
- faster computers

\note{

Moore's law and the Internet have produced a virtuous cycle of exponential growth in data, computational power, and medical technology.

# Virtuous cycle

diagram of arrows of computer tech feeding back into medical tech and spinoff technologies radiating out from that virtuous cycle

## technology <-> science

- neuroscience -> deep learning -> lstm, attention
- gene sequencing -> encoder/decoder -> NLP -> human genome -> 23andme (genetics)
- 2D gene sequencing -> topology, deep learning -> 3D gene sequencing
- MRI -> optical cortex neuroscience -> computer vision architectures -> FMRI
- psychometrics -> goal-based reasoning
- psychology/philosophy -> fuzzy logic -> bayesean networks -> causal diagrams
- BMI -> steven hawking -> physics and math -> better BMI
- wikipedia, pub med -> more educated patients and doctors -> self-help medicine
- embedded processes -> insulin pumps and pace makers -> more data -> treatments for computer scientists

\note{

Faster and faster computers have enabled computer scientists, physicicists, chemists, and biologists to test and experiment with more and more efficient models and algorithms for biological systems.
And those algorithms have helped scientists generate and record more and more data about biology.
And surprisingly, that data about human biology has spawned new biomimicing algorithms that are better than engineered algorithms for solving many computer science problems.
For example, as we learn more and more about the human brain and neurobiology we are able to apply more and more of that architecture insight into thinking machines, like artificial neural networks.
It's that one advancement, often called deep learning that has
and advance medical technology which have in turned generated more data and life-saving technologies to motivate additional investment and growth in technology.

# Gene Sequencing

\note{

The sequencing of the human genome, containing 3B base would not have been possible if it weren't for fast comptures with vast storage.
23andme, fitbit spawned a citizen science and self-service medicine trend (quantified self)

# What is a data scientist

- A statistician that can program
- A computer programmer than understand statistics
- A statstician that lives in Silicon Valley

\note{

So you want to be a data scientist so you can help save lives?

# Healthcare Data Science

- Individual Clinical Healthcare
- Occupational Health and Safety
- Population Health

::: notes

Clin health -- individual patient diagnosis and treatment
Occ health -- monitoring and design of the workplace for worker health and safety
Pop health -- Epidemiology and spatio-temporal data modeling

# A slide to show overlay tricks

\only<1,3>{This text appears on the first and third versions of the slide, but not the second.}

This uses beamer's highlighting command to \alert<2>{draw attention here}, but only on the second slide.

\note<1>{

Notes can also have overlay specs. First slide version note.

And third. Use \LaTeX\ macros in notes, like \emph{emphasis}.
